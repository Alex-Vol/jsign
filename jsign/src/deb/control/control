Description: Code signing for Windows executables, Microsoft Installers and PowerShell scripts
 Jsign is a Java implementation of Microsoft Authenticode that lets you sign
 and timestamp executable files for Windows, Microsoft Installers (MSI) and
 PowerShell scripts. Jsign is platform independent and provides an alternative
 to native tools like signcode/signtool on Windows or the Mono development
 tools on Unix systems.
